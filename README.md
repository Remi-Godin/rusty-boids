### What I know
I know that boids works on 3 rules:
- fly towards other boids
- match the direction of other boids around itself
- avoid collision

I also know that a popular data structure used for optimization in boids is quad-trees.

This is much of what I know about the subject. For the purpose of learning, I will
try to avoid reading on boids implementation and try to do it all on my own. Then
I will try optimizing the best way I can.
